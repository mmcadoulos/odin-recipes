    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This delicious gyro meat is the closest I've come to emulating my favorite
      Mediterranean restaurant's recipe. The Greek/Lebanese-style meatloaf is
      sliced and served with pita bread, tzatziki, and tomatoes. The preparation
      time seems long, but most of it is resting time, so you can be doing other
      things!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ medium onion, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
      <li>1 pound 80/20 ground beef</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground dried rosemary</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground dried thyme</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons fine sea salt</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Pulse onion in a food processor until finely chopped, about 5 (1-second)
        pulses. Scoop onions onto the center of a towel, gather up the towel
        ends, and squeeze to remove liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine onions, lamb, beef, garlic, oregano, cumin, marjoram, rosemary,
        thyme, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Mix with your hands until well
        combined. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours to allow the flavors to
        blend. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Evenly coat a
        9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in 2 batches if necessary, place meat mixture into a food
        processor and pulse until finely chopped and the texture feels tacky,
        about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer mixture into prepared loaf pan, and pack down to make sure
        there are no air pockets. Line a medium roasting pan with a damp kitchen
        towel. Place the loaf pan in the center of the towel-lined roasting pan,
        and transfer it into the preheated oven. Carefully pour boiling water
        into the roasting pan until it comes halfway up the sides of the loaf
        pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until gyro meat is no longer pink in the
        center, about 1 hour to 1 hour 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour off any accumulated fat, and allow to cool slightly before slicing
        thinly and serving.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
